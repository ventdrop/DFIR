# DFIR Resources
This is a repo that will eventually contain various resources that I have created for use in DFIR/Threat Hunting/Malware Analysis. I am hoping to upload the following: 
- Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Queries (KQL)
- Splunk Queries (SPL)
- Volatililty Profiles (Linux)
- Python Scripts
- Others

These resources are public and available for use 

Future blog posts with guides, write-ups and how-to's will be found at https://ventdrop.github.io
